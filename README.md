# tatum-csharp
This library simplifies usage of [Tatum](https://docs.tatum.io/) blockchain developer platform from C# applications. It allows you to call [Tatum API](https://tatum.io/apidoc) endpoints directly as methods from code. All operations that require sensitive data are performed locally, so no private keys are sent anywhere.
## Nuget package
You can link this library as a standard Nuget package.
