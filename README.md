# tatum-csharp
This library simplifies usage of [Tatum](https://docs.tatum.io/) blockchain developer platform from C# applications. It allows you to call [Tatum API](https://tatum.io/apidoc) endpoints directly as methods from code. Library also validates inputs before calling the API, so you won't waste resources and credits. All operations that require sensitive data are performed locally, so no private keys are sent anywhere.
## Nuget package
You can link this library as a standard Nuget package.
