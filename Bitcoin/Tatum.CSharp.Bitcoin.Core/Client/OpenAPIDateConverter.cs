 * # Welcome to the Tatum API Reference!  ## What is Tatum?  Tatum offers a flexible framework to build, run, and scale blockchain apps fast. To learn more about the Tatum blockchain development framework, visit [our website](https://tatum.io/framework).  The Tatum API features powerful endpoints that simplify a complex blockchain into single API requests. Code for all supported blockchains using unified API calls.  ## Supported blockchains  Tatum supports multiple blockchains and various blockchain features.  Because not all blockchains function identically, Tatum supports a different set of features on each blockchain.  To see all the blockchains that Tatum supports, please refer to [this article](https://docs.tatum.io/introduction/supported-blockchains).  ## Need help?  To chat with other developers, get help from the Support team, and engage with the thriving Tatum community, join  our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tatum). For more information about how to work with Tatum, review the [online documentation](https://docs.tatum.io/).  # Authentication  When using the Tatum API, you authenticate yourself with an **API key**. <SecurityDefinitions />
