 * # Welcome to the Tatum API Reference!  ## What is Tatum?  Tatum offers a flexible framework to build, run, and scale blockchain apps fast. To learn more about the Tatum blockchain development framework, visit [our website](https://tatum.io/framework).  The Tatum API features powerful endpoints that simplify a complex blockchain into single API requests. Code for all supported blockchains using unified API calls.  ## Supported blockchains  Tatum supports multiple blockchains and various blockchain features.  Because not all blockchains function identically, Tatum supports a different set of features on each blockchain.  To see all the blockchains that Tatum supports, please refer to [this article](https://docs.tatum.io/introduction/supported-blockchains).  ## Need help?
